## Stackfu9 is

- pronounced "stack fuck"
  - 9 is "kyuu" or "ku" in Japanese
- inspired by brainfuck

## Stackfu9
- has a stack
- has 9 operands

  - I'll make it [ELVM](https://github.com/shinh/elvm) backend

## Operands

- ^ (jump  ) : pop 1, jump
- % (roll  ) : pop 1, roll

####jump
Pop stack top and let this be n.  
If n is positive, jump right n-th.  
If n is negative, jump left n-th.  
(I mean "Jump n-th", not "Jump to label".)

####roll
Pop stack top and let this be n.  
Pop the stack top and insert it at the n-th of stack.

    | a b c d e f g 4
    â†“roll
    | a b c g d e f
            ^ now g is 4th of stack
